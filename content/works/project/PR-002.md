I am conceptualizing a short comic set in a near-future Seoul that has failed to resolve its population and regional imbalance issues. This illustration serves as a type of concept art, depicting the comic's opening sequence beginning with an exploding Seoul Station. It was drawn in Adobe Photoshop and riso-printed on A2 portrait-format comic paper.
